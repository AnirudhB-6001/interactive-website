    When I first decided to explore cybersecurity, I had no idea how deep the rabbit hole went. 
    Coming from a sales and tech background, I was used to working with tech products but had never actually built something technical myself. The idea of creating a Capture the Flag (CTF) game came from a mix of curiosity, a desire to learn, and a need to apply my newfound coding skills in a meaningful way.
    CTF games are used by cybersecurity professionals and learners to test their skills in hacking, cryptography, and problem-solving. I wanted to build something simple yet engaging—a game where users could solve cybersecurity challenges interactively.
    Phase 1: Setting the Foundations (Feb 15, 2025)
    Choosing the Tech Stack
    The first challenge was picking the right technology. Since I was already learning Flask (Python) for backend development, it made sense to use it for serving our game challenges. 
    I decided to: 
    Use Flask as the backend API 
    Store challenge data within the backend itself (for now, no database) ✅ Make the game fully interactive using API endpoints
    This was the first time I was building a structured API from scratch, and I quickly realized that designing routes properly was crucial. I had to think about how challenges would be served, how answers would be submitted, and how the system would validate responses.
    Our First API Routes
    The first Flask API routes we implemented were:
    GET /api/challenge → Fetches a challenge.
    POST /api/submit → Submits an answer and checks if it's correct.
    I tested these using curl commands, and to my surprise, it worked smoothly on the first attempt!"
