## Understanding Base64
Base64 encoding is **not encryption** but a way to convert binary data into text. It’s commonly used in steganography and data obfuscation.

### First Challenge:
Decode this secret message: U2VjdXJpdHlJc0Z1bg==

✅ Expected Answer: `SecurityIsFun`

### What I Learned:
- Base64 **does not add security** but is useful for encoding data.
- I used **Python to decode messages** and submit answers in my game.
- Getting my **first CTF flag** felt amazing!
