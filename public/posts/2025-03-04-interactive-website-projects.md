# ðŸ’¡ The Projects Section: Making It Functional (Feb 2025)

## **Creating a Structured Approach**
- Built a `projects.json` file for managing project entries.
- Allowed embedding of images, videos, and PDFs.
- Designed a scalable way to add new projects without modifying code.

## **Handling Large Media Files**
- Encountered issues with GitHubâ€™s 100MB file limit.
- Decided to **host large files externally** instead of committing them.
- Integrated external links instead of direct file uploads.
