## Stability & Final Testing

After all major changes, we ran extensive tests with **edge-case queries**:

✅ Handled **typos**  
✅ Improved **response accuracy**  
✅ Reduced **failure rate** for missing data  

## Remaining Issues

⚠️ Some indicators **still don’t fetch valid results** (e.g., *Ease of Doing Business*).  
⚠️ The bot misinterprets certain **query structures** (e.g., `"poverty rate of UK"` vs. `"poverty in UK"`).  
⚠️ **Map visualizations** haven’t been implemented yet.  

At this point, **Map Bot was stable but not perfect**.

## Final Thoughts: Lessons Learned

💡 **Keep JSON Structures Simple**  
- The moment we **over-complicated** `indicators.json`, everything **broke**.

💡 **Preload Data Instead of Fetching it Live**  
- Relying on **API calls for every request** slowed down the bot. A **local cache** would help.

💡 **Error Handling is Critical**  
- Instead of failing, returning **“No data available”** prevents user frustration.

💡 **Natural Language Processing Still Needs Work**  
- The bot **struggles with complex query variations**, requiring **further improvements**.

## Next Steps for Map Bot 🚀

🔹 **Adding Map-Based Visualizations**  
🔹 **Expanding Data Sources Beyond the World Bank**  
🔹 **Deploying Map Bot as a Public Web App**  
🔹 **Refining NLP Capabilities for Better Query Understanding**  

From a **simple GDP chatbot** to a **modular AI assistant for global data**, **Map Bot** has come a long way.

The journey **isn’t over yet**, but this marks a major **milestone** in its development. 🎯
