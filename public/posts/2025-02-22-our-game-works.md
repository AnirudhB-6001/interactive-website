## Testing the Game Mechanics
After fixing multiple issues, the game **finally worked**!

âœ… **Fetching Challenges**
```bash
$ curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/challenge
{
  "prompt": "Decode this secret message: U2VjdXJpdHlJc0Z1bg==",
  "title": "Decode the Message"
}

âœ… Submitting a Wrong Answer

$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/submit -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"answer": "WrongAnswer"}'
{
  "error": "Incorrect answer, try again"
}

âœ… Submitting the Correct Answer

$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/submit -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"answer": "SecurityIsFun"}'
{
  "flag": "CTF{well_done_you_cracked_it}"
}

Seeing this response was the best feeling ever! ðŸš€

## Future Plans for the Game
With the basic CTF game functional, my **next goals** are:
âœ… **New challenge types** (XOR Cipher, SQL Injection, etc.)  
âœ… **Making the game more dynamic** by introducing a challenge database  
âœ… **Expanding the learning journey** with cybersecurity concepts  

### Lessons Learned:
- **Deployment is tricky**â€”get the project working locally first.
- **CTF challenges require creative problem-solving.**
- **Documentation is crucial**â€”hence this blog!

ðŸš€ Looking forward to the next phase of this journey!
