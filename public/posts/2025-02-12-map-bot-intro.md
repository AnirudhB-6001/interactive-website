## Introduction

Map Bot started as an ideaâ€”a simple chatbot that could fetch economic and financial data from the **World Bank API**. The goal was to create a tool that allowed users to quickly retrieve country-specific statistics, compare global indicators, and even visualize data on maps.

Over the course of development, the project went through multiple iterations. We started with a **basic chatbot** and later expanded its capabilities to support **fuzzy matching for countries**, **external JSON-based storage for indicators**, and **error handling for missing data**. Along the way, we encountered technical roadblocks, refined our approach, and eventually stabilized a working system.

This blog serves as a detailed **technical timeline**, documenting key milestones, challenges, and solutions in building **Map Bot**.
