## The Caesar Cipher Challenge
The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the oldest encryption methods, shifting letters by a fixed number.

Example:
Original: HELLO
Shifted (3 places): KHOOR

To decrypt, shift back by the same number.

### Implementing the Challenge:
✅ **Dynamic shifting** – Players must figure out the shift value.  
✅ **Python script** to decrypt messages.  

This was the first time I built a **real cryptography challenge** in my game!
