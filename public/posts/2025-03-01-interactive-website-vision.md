# ðŸš€ The Vision & Getting Started (Oct 2024)

## **Why I Wanted to Build This Website**
- Personal branding and showcasing projects.
- Learning web development from scratch.
- The decision to build something interactive instead of a static site.

## **Choosing the Tech Stack**
- React with Vite for frontend.
- Netlify for free hosting and easy deployment.
- Markdown and JSON for content management (at first).
- Initial hurdles in picking between frameworks.

## **Setting Up the First Version**
- Bought the domain **anirudhbatraofficial.com**.
- Configured DNS settings and connected the domain to Netlify.
- Initial push to GitHub and successful deployment.
