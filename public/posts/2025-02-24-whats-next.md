## Future Plans for the Game
With the basic CTF game functional, my **next goals** are:
- **New challenge types** (XOR Cipher, SQL Injection, etc.)  
- **Making the game more dynamic** by introducing a challenge database  
- **Expanding the learning journey** with cybersecurity concepts  

### Lessons Learned:
- **Deployment is tricky**—get the project working locally first.
- **CTF challenges require creative problem-solving.**
- **Documentation is crucial**—hence this blog!

Looking forward to the next phase of this journey!
